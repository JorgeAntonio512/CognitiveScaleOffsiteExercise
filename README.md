George A Pazdral's Offsite Exericse for Cognitive Scale
-------------------------------------------------------

This program has two functions:

1) when you input and submit a string, the output will
be different colored blocks. The string can only be
twelve characters long.

2) the string is saved to MongoDB, and is placed at the
bottom of the webpage. The search box function on the 
webpage allows a user to see the cumulative total of any
character that has been input and submitted.


Stay tuned for a link to the working webpage.
